                    <h2>Tea Industry took a blow</h2>
                    <p>
                        Due to the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, for the last few months, the country has been gripped by severe shortages of fuel, food and other essentials after its foreign reserves dried up. The country owes more than $51 billion to foreign lenders and inflation runs at more than 50%. <br>
                        Industry insiders point out that before the country's economic crisis, tea exports accounted for US$1.3 billion annually and 5% of all global tea production, but this has now dropped drastically to its lowest level in over two decades.The tea industry, now over 150 years in existence, is faced with a crisis. Any donations, big or small could help the Sri Lankan Tea industry in ways you can't imagine!
