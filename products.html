                <h1>Tea Tree Oil</h1>
                <p>Tea tree oil, also known as melaleuca oil, is an essential oil with a fresh camphoraceous odor and a colour that ranges from pale yellow to nearly colourless and clear. It is derived from the leaves of the tea tree, Melaleuca alternifolia.</p>
                <div class="sides">
                    <h2>Uses</h2>
                    <p>Tea tree oil has been used as a traditional herbal medicine in the belief it treats acne, nail fungus, or athlete's foot, with little evidence to support these uses.</p>
                    <h2>Cost</h2>
                    <p>Mostly available in 15 and 30ml bottles, typically ranging from LKR 1,200 to 2,400</p>

                <h1>Dyes</h1>
                <p>Tea dyeing is a easy and economic way for anyone to dye clothing or linens. Tea dyeing is often used to give fabrics an aged or antique look. Many people enjoy dyeing material with tea because of the variety of colors and shades that are possible, as well as the tradition itself of tea baths.</p>
                <div class="sides">
                    <h2>Why Tea Dye?</h2>
                    <p>Dyeing with tea is easy, inexpensive, and gives your textiles a rich earthy color. Tea is rich in tannins which bonds well with natural fibers, which means that it doesn't require a mordant (a substance used to bind the dye to the fabric). It is a great choice for those who are new to dyeing.</p>

                <h1>Tea Soaps</h1>
                <p>“Tea Soap” was produced as a unique floating soap, and follows the traditional manufacturing processes. It is extracted from natural herbs and combined with these herbs to become a natural and pure handmade soap, free from any chemicals.</p>
                <div class="sides"> 
                    <h2>What is green tea soap good for?</h2>
