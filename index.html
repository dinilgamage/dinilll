                    <p>Introduced in 1867, Ceylon Tea has grown to be the top agriculture export in Sri Lanka and provides direct and indirect employment to nearly 1 million people while around 4% of the country’s land area is covered in tea plantations
                        amounting to nearly 203000 hectares.</p>
                    <p>Sri Lanka is an island made for tea. The country produces tea throughout the year and the total tea production is about 340 million kilograms per annum. Sri Lanka’s tea-growing areas are mainly concentrated in the central highlands
                        and southern inland areas of the island. </p>

                <div class="history-dets">
                    <p>James Taylor arrived in Ceylon in 1852, settling down at the Loolecondera Estate, Galaha. He begins a 19-acre tea plantation on the Loolecondera Estate in 1867, laying the foundation for what would become Sri Lanka’s largest export industry for over a century.

                    In 1872, a fully equipped tea factory began operating on the Loolecondera Estate.
                        
                    In 1873, Ceylon Tea made its international debut when twenty-three pounds of tea produced by James Taylor reached London.</p>

                    <h2>Why Sri Lankan Tea?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Passion & Provenance – Ceylon Tea is grown and produced according to uncompromising, traditional methods and standards since 1880.</li>
                        <li>Sri Lanka is considered a model to the world across the value chain, from growing to production and from physical distribution to the most admired auction system in the world.</li>
                        <li>Diversity – Ceylon Tea is much loved for its unmatched quality and variety in taste, character and appearance based on the different parts of its tea growing regions. The 7 agro climatic regions - Nuwara Eliya, Uva, Uda Pussellawa, Dimbula, Kandy, Ruhuna & Sabaragamuwa</li>
                        <li>Ceylon Teas are Handpicked -The relative amounts of the polyphenols present in tea, the polyphenol oxidase (enzyme), the theaflavins, thearubigins, caffeine, essential oils, sugars, amino acids in the bud and the first two tender leaves will all contribute to the quality of the brewed liquor in a positive way. Hence the importance of traditional and disciplined picking of teas in Ceylon.</li>

                <div class="ordered-list">
                    <h2>What about any Health Benefits?</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Natural substances, called polyphenols, are found in both caffeinated and herbal teas. These substances are antioxidants, compounds that may help reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases.</li>
                        <li>Though the jury is still out, some studies suggest that the caffeine and catechins, a type of polyphenol, in tea may help with weight loss. Decaffeinated green teas did not appear to produce the same results.</li>
                        <li>Tea drinkers may be helping to keep their hearts healthy. Some research has shown a reduced risk of heart disease in people who drink green or black tea regularly.</li>
                        <li>Some studies suggest that the catechins in green tea may help to keep blood sugar in check, reducing the risk for developing Type 2 diabetes.</li>
                        <li>Some studies suggest that tea drinkers have a lower risk for certain types of cancer.</li>
